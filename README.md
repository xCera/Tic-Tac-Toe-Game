# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Simple Tic Tac Toe Game built with Javascript

I am currently studying web development, so I decided to make one simple game, Tic Tac Toe. 
I haven't watched any tutorials and I have no idea if this is the best way to program this game, but it's important that it works.
Any criticism or suggestion is welcome!
